"The organizing principle of the brain and therefore drivers of beavior is to
minimize threat and maximize reward" - Mathew something


The Mind Managing the Present and The Future

The immediate and the long-term satisfaction of needs - a battle that concerns
a choice based on what we value most

Our "alarm system" - immediate threats!
Our "reward systsem" - immediate rewards!

### The SCARF Model

The SCARF model is developed to help us understand what motivate versus
disengage ourselves and others.

This knowledge could guide our behavior when we collaborate with other.

In short, if we manage to behave in a way that makes others feel safe and
rewarded, the group will have

SCARF:

Status: one's sense of importance relative to others.

Certainty: one's need for clarity and the ability to make accurate predictions
about the future.

Autonomy: one's sense of control over the events in life and the perception
that one's behavior has an effect on the outcome of a situation.

Relatedness: one's sense of connection to and security with other people.

Fairness: one's perception of a just and non-biased exchange between people.
