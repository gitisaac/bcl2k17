# IP and entrepreneurship in the Matrix

### Knowledge-Based Business Management
Innovation and technology is useless without any business strategy, and it's not worth to create a business ithout a strategy for control (IPS).

### Understanding commercial and societal reality as a structural Matrix
We need to know how the made up world works, and what the code is, norms and such.

Karl Marx says that we get reaffied, that we are so used to some things that it becoms the one reality. For example wearing a white dress for your wedding, or using an 'osthyvel' for the cheese and not a knife.

The Matrix provides a structure, and that can often be useful. There is no political party that don't want public healthcare. However, sometimes we need to revisit the structure to change it for the better.

What you read in the book is the Matrix, but you need to learn the code in order to play the game. For example, You cannot pattent software, but software is still being pattented, and that is because it is called something else. Play the game.

The theory we are learning here is metatheory, which means theory about everything. In order to properly see the world one needs a good theoretical understanding. Becoming more theoretical is the end goal of this course. And we learn by doing.

### Tangible Vs. Intangible
Tangible assets are physical assets such as land, vehicles, equipment, machinery, furniture, inventory, stock, bonds, and cash. These assets are the backbone of a company but are not available to customers. Tangible assets are at risk of damage either from naturally occuring incidents, theft or accidents.
