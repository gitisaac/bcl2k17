# IP and entrepreneurship in the Matrix

### Knowledge-Based Business Management
Innovation and technology is useless without any business strategy, and it's not worth to create a business ithout a strategy for control (IPS).

### Understanding commercial and societal reality as a structural Matrix
We need to know how the made up world works, and what the code is, norms and such.

Karl Marx says that we get reaffied, that we are so used to some things that it becoms the one reality. For example wearing a white dress for your wedding, or using an 'osthyvel' for the cheese and not a knife.

The Matrix provides a structure, and that can often be useful. There is no political party that don't want public healthcare. However, sometimes we need to revisit the structure to change it for the better.

What you read in the book is the Matrix, but you need to learn the code in order to play the game. For example, You cannot pattent software, but software is still being pattented, and that is because it is called something else. Play the game.

The theory we are learning here is metatheory, which means theory about everything. In order to properly see the world one needs a good theoretical understanding. Becoming more theoretical is the end goal of this course. And we learn by doing.

### Tangible Vs. Intangible
Tangible assets are physical assets such as:
 - land
 - vehicles
 - equipment
 - machinery
 - furniture
 - inventory
 - stock
 - bonds
 - cash
These assets are the backbone of a company but are not available to customers. Tangible assets are at risk of damage either from naturally occuring incidents, theft or accidents.

Intangible assets are nonphysical, such as:
- patents
- trademarks
- franchises
- goodwill
- copyrights
Depending on the type of business, intagible assets may include:
- internet domain names
- performance events
- licensing agreements
- service contracts
- computer software
- blueprints
- manuscripts
- joint ventures
- medical records
- permits
- trade secrets
Intangible assets add to a company's possible future worth and can be much more valuable than its tangible assets. In the 70's the market value of S&P 500 lied in 80% tangible assets and 20% intangible. Today it's reversed, intagible assets make up for 80% and tangible for 20%.

### Capital as a Social Construction
>The total value of real estate not legally owned by the poor of the Third
>World and former communist nations is at least $9,3 trillion... about
>twice as much as the total circulating US money supply... and nearly
>as much as the total value of all the companies listed on the main
>stock exchanges of the world’s twenty most developed countries...
>twenty times the total direct foreign investment into all Third World and
>former communist countries in the ten years after 1989… forty-six
>times as much as all the World Bank loans of the past three decades,
>and ninety-three times as much as all development assistance from all
>advanced countries to the Third World in the same period.
- Hernando de Soto, *The Mystery of Capital*

>[LDCs] hold resources in defective forms: houses built on land whose
>ownership rights are not adequately recorded, unincorporated
>businesses with undefined liability, industries located where financiers
>and investors cannot see them. Because the rights to these
>possessions are not adequately documented, these assets cannot be
>traded into capital, cannot be traded outside of narrow circles where
>people know and trust each other, cannot be used as collateral for a
>loan and cannot be used as a share against an investment.
- Hernando de Soto, *The Mystery of Capital*
