# Intellectual asset management 2

### IPR as key tools in knowledge-based business
- Trademark Right Management
  - Building brands and concepts
- Copyright Management
  - building virtual products and leveraging content
- Patent Management

### Knowledge economy
#### *Example 1: Shoes*
Producing shoes with the only goal in mind is to produce something that will
protect people's shoes, you will not make money.
That is why you need Branding and Trademark Right Management

#### *Example 2: Coffee*
You wont make money going around selling coffee beans by the kilo, instead
you can make much more money with something like Nespresso. When you buy
Nespresso you buy the brand (Luxury)  not (only) coffee.

>It's how you add the intellectual properties on the coffee that creates the
value for Nespresso.
-Bowman Heiden

### Volvo
> You don't have to be the safest car in the world, but only to make people
believe that you are the safest car in the world, it's all about branding,
and marketing, IP and so on
-Bowman Heiden

### Merchandize
Licensing a known trademark/brand on your products can greatly increase the
product's value, like *Star Wars* in *Lego Star Wars*

### Copyright licensing

Because of the copyright law(s) the music industry can have writers, composers,
and artists working together, and everyone gains money.

Another example is J.K. Rowling, creating a book, then license for movies,
games, and other merchandize.

### More on knowledge economy

Back in the days when software was ripped on a disk packed inside in a plastic
package with a shrink wrap seal. When this seal was broken you entered into
an end user license agreement, and you never own the software per say.
Today we, instead have click wrap, which means that you have to click agree
when you install some proprietary software trough the world wide web.

>Getting a patent is far from getting a monopoly on the market area of the
patent. Maybe the only possible area where one can get a monopoly through a
patent is within pharmaceuticals. This is because of the uniqueness of
of chemical compunds
