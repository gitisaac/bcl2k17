# Business Creation

### The idea and the idea-provider
#### An example: Brånemark-screw/system
Brånemark System is synonymous with the revolutionary concept of
osseointegration, which introduced safe and effective implant treatments to
modern dentistry.

We tend to start with intellectual assets, i.e., what technology, design,
trademarks etc. shall the firm control? Here we start off with a technology
push. We have some technology that we want to find the best market fit for.

We then start to look into the business creation. What business and market
position shall the firm control? And then we should get a better idea of what
we lack in the intellectual assets.

The industrial value chain is the basis of the structural matrix.

After considering the business creation, we take care of the structure of the
company. Under which association and company structure should the firm
be controlled?

A big challange of structuring the company is the ownership of the company.
How shall the ownership and share-holding of the firm be governed. And ownership
brings up the question of financial capital. Which financial resources do the
firm need to control?

Corporate fincance is something that many of will work with, or at least spend
a lot of time with as a stratup company.

Organization. What organizational capability shall the firm control?

Work performer. What human capital shall the firm control? There are a lot of
issues when it comes to bringing in new people, like secrecy agreements, salary,
shares and so on.

Fixed assets. What real estate and other fixed assets shall the firm control.

### General considerations of intellectual assets

claim if to be able to perform?

- step 4. Operations: How do we ensure the concrete activities?
