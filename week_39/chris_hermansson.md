# Intro to IPRs and Innovation
### 25.09.17

There are 2 types of uncertainties:
- Controlled: What this course mainly focuses on.
- Uncontrolled: when things get fucked up for good.

There will be a written exam, but also a couple of exercises,
and the learnings from the exercises will be crucial to have for the exam.

We will also have a patent case, with a presentation and report. The report
will be the graded part, but a good presentation can raise one's grade if one is
between two grades.

We will also have to pass a IPS quiz (on pingpong?)

> If you can't come to an exercise session you'll have to send in a written
document.

### Some practicalities

- Reading list - section Resources -reading materials - IPS
  - Will be slightly updated - a few articles will be added!
- Consulation case work
  - More info will follo, see pingpong
- You have space in the schedule to work on your assignments, cases, hand-ins
etc.
- Messages, exercises, other info (Questel) etc. will be distributed on
Pingpong

### Todays agenda

- Static or dynamic use of patents (IPRs)
- Designing an innovation as an intellectual object

### Patents

- Protection. A patent allows the patent holder to exclude other from
commercially exploiting the invention covered by the patent in a certain
country or region and for a specific period of time, generally not exceeding
20 years.

- Disclosure. A patent gives the public access to information regarding new
technologies in order to stimulate innovation and contribute to economic growth.


#### Patent as a legal tool

Some examples:
_Static (product centric logic)_

- _A legal right_
-- to block other from entering technology areas
-- to block others from entering product market
-- to exclude other from using an invention

#### Patent as a business tool

Some examples:
_Dynamic (network-based logic)_

- Create sustainable open innovation structures
- Build new business models
- Build and control new markets

#### The patent as a tool - examples (non-exhaustive list)

- Expose the inventor
- Expose the rightholder
- Design the protection for the inventrion
- Defining the innovation
- A basis for funding
- A bargaining position
- Market position
- Basis for licence structures
- Basis for knowledge exchange
- Deterring patent conflicts
