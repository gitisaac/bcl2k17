# Knowing your IPR essentials :money_with_wings:

- *What* can be claimed?
- *how* dow we claim it?
- What does the claim *imply*
- *Who* gets the control?
- How do we *maintain* the claim?
- How durable is the claim over *time*?
- *Exceptions*?
- *Sanctions*?

### Understanding 'the game' :game_die:

####### The 4 arenas:
- Administrative
  - Claiming and filing for patents, protecting IPR's
- Judical
  - Lawyers within a company working with lawsuits, making sure no one is
  infringing on the firms IP's
- Business
  - In most cases the business arena is probably the most important one
- Political
  - For example, the Swedish Piracy party are currently trying to change the law
  regarding piracy, thus changing the rules of the game

All you need is :moneybag:
Intellectual Assets + Intellectual Properties + IP Strategy + Business Model

### What does a strong claim mean?
- Trademarks
- Patents
- Copyright
- Trade Secrets
- Contracts
- Etc.

Land in developed countries like Sweden are safe assets, on the other hand, in
developing countries land is pretty much unsafe; a spot of land can be yours
one day, and another day someone can come and explain to you that it is not
yours anymore, and that there's been a mistake in the administration.

IP is like land in developing countries, *you* have to be the one in charge of
making sure that no one is infringing on your IP's etc.

### The intellectual asset assessment
Performing an intellectual asset assessment is a good starting point in most
ventures!
