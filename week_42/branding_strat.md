# Branding strategies with Anna Holmberg :ok_woman:

### 1. What is a brand?

Example: A famous violinist named Yoshua Bell, performed on the trainstation
playing some expert level tunes, but no one listened. But the violin's cost
is 3.5 milli. When performing on the Opera, his tickets sells out a month
before.

Example: 2 identical white T-shirts, one made by 'acne?' and one made by HM.
The acne one is 10 times more expensive, and doesn't even have a logo on it.
This proves that the branding is still important even though it isn't visible.

##### Quoute of the day:
##### NO 1.
> A brand is a name with the power to influence buyers
##### NO 2.
> A brand is a shared desirable and exclusive idea embodied in products,
services, places and/or experiences.

#### Another quoute, why not?

> A brand is a persons gut feeling about a product, service, or company.
It's not what you say it is. **It's what THEY say it is**

- Marty Neumeier?

### What is a brand?
All aspects working together to create a consumer experience and thereby
a position in the mind of the consumer.

Hard to control the mind of the consumer.

- A lot of psychology
- Subjective and quick to change

As abrand you have to be one step ahead of the consumers, a brands reputation
takes a lot of time and effort to build up, but is very easily destroyed,
just like relations between persons or countries.

### A Volvo example
In essence Volvo changed their branding strategy very quickly, from a boring
steroetype mobile for old men, to a premium Swedish high quality type of mobile
for everybody
