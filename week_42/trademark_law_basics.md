# Trademark law basics :laughing:

### Branding

Not only companies have brands, but also countries, people, etc.
Brands is used as the brand owners identity.

###### Why do people wear Ralph Lauren clothing? :frog:
_Common argument:_ It's much better quality than other non-expensive clothing
That argument is most often wrong for expensive brand stuff.
The real reason is that people want to identify with the exculisveness of the
brand, feel included in a group of like-minded people etc.

###### How many brands have you encountered today?
**A lot** :eyes:
*New life goal:* Have no items with visible brands :neckbeard:

How much of your own identity is in other brands??

### Functions and purposes of the trademark
###### Dual purpose
1. Consumer protection - protecting the commercial origin of a certain product
2. Grant rights to trademark holders to promote fair and loyal competition -
protecting the holder of a trade mark against competitors trying to use the
goodwill of the mark

### Trademarks - relevant legislation
###### National legislation
- Swedish Trademarks Act(2010:1877)
- Swedish Trademark Regulation (2011:594)

###### Other applicable national legislation
- Swedish Trade Names Act (1974:156) (NOTE: PG is the company, but their trade
marks is in their products, like Gilette)
- Swedish Marketing Practices Act (2008:486)

###### Important legislative acts of the European Union
- Trademark Directive 2008/95/EC
- European Union Trade mark Regulation (EU) 2017/1001

### Trademark protection
Registration -> (R)
Trademark (when you consider your shit trademarked) -> â„¢

### Registration vs. establishment
###### The benefits of registration are:
- Automatically a defined geographical area of protection
- Automatically a defined scope of products
- Automatically a defined commencement of protection
- Easier to prove existence of your right
- Easier to transfer
- Less risk of infringement

###### Consider:
- Registration costs vs. cost of (proving) establishment
- Easier for competitors to find a registration than an established mark

### Different kinds of registrable trademarks

- In most jurisdictions - _Graphically Representable_
- Word mark:
  - Name Adidas, Coca-cola, Chanel
  - Slogan ***JUST DO IT***
